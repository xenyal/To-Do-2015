## Things to remember by the end of 2015!
> Small repo to keep track of goals and whatnot. This repo will be populated with markdown files for each topic/subtopic in the checklist below - list members will _eventually_ be linked to respective directories containing detailed notes for that subject with corresponding examples in various langs.

## Checklist:

1. SOLID Design Principles
  * [Single-responsibility principle](https://github.com/xenyal/To-Do-2015/tree/master/SOLID/SRP)
  * [Open-close principle](https://github.com/xenyal/To-Do-2015/tree/master/SOLID/OCP)
  * [Liskov substitution principle](https://github.com/xenyal/To-Do-2015/tree/master/SOLID/LSP)
  * [Interface segregation principle](https://github.com/xenyal/To-Do-2015/tree/master/SOLID/ISP)
  * [Dependency inversion principle](https://github.com/xenyal/To-Do-2015/tree/master/SOLID/DIP)

2. GOF Design Patterns
	* Creational Patterns
	  * Abstract Factory: Creates an instance of several families of classes
	  * Builder: Separates object construction from its representation
	  * Factory Method: Creates an instance of several derived classes
	  * Prototype: A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned	
	  * Singleton: A class of which only a single instance can exist

	* Structural Patterns
	  * Adapter: Match interfaces of different classes
	  * Bridge: Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
	  * Composite: A tree structure of simple and composite objects
	  * Decorator: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
	  * Facade: A single class that represents an entire subsystem
	  * Flyweight: A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
	  * Proxy: An object representing another object

	* Behavioral Patterns
	  * Chain of Resp.: A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
	  * Command: Encapsulate a command request as an object
	  * Interpreter: A way to include language elements in a program
	  * Iterator: Sequentially access the elements of a collection
	  * Mediator: Defines simplified communication between classes
	  * Memento: Capture and restore an object's internal state
	  * Observer: A way of notifying change to a number of classes
	  * State: Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
	  * Strategy: Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
	  * Template: Method	Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
	  * Visitor: Defines a new operation to a class without change
